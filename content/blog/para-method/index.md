### Introduction to The PARA Method
The PARA System was introduced by [Thiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com). It is a method to organise informations that will enter your life. It consists of 4 things:

#### Projects

Projects are series of tasks with `deadlines`.

#### Areas

Areas are activities to be maintained `overtime`.

#### Resources

Resources are `topic / theme` of ongoing interests.

#### Archives

Archives are `inactive items` from the other 3.

### How My System Looks before PARA
My system was very messy. I usually put everything in random places from my files, notes, and todos. And because of that I found it hard to find them when I wanted to. Beside my messy systems I don't integrate every single one of them between my apps. So some things will be on my todolist app and some things will be on my notes app. It was a disaster.

Where did I put those important links for work?

Where did I put those books recommendation?

Where did I put those notes?

It was really hard to answer these questions.

How can I be productive when I couldn't retrieve informations when I wanted to?
That was the moment when I realized that I need to change my own system.

### Why Did I Choose PARA?
I discovered PARA from people that I admired from Twitter and that was the moment I got interested in it. Then I did a research on it and I found the idea of building a second brain is really interesting. 

I tend to forget most of the things that I have learned. I love to read but it seems really hard to regain those informations from books that I have read. I thought that by building a second brain it will also help me to fix this kind of problem.

Lastly, I think that this PARA method is really simple and straightforward so I can implement this straight away and incrementally improve on it.

## My Early Struggle with PARA
Because of my old messy systems, it was hard to group files, notes, etc into the PARA system. So when I first implemented the PARA method into my current system I need to filter out everything and put it in place. It was a struggle and it took a lot of time. I don't want to do this all over again so I made sure that everything was in its place.

I also messed up my understanding of Projects, Areas, and Resources. I misplaced a lot of things and ended up confused. I had a call with Dan Shipper about it and he helped me to understand it better. To be honest I still misplace stuff up until now. I guess that is a part of learning.

It was hard to sync everything at first between my notes and todos. This happened because I keep my notes separated from my todos. I need to find a way to sync them. It is still an ongoing process for me.

### My Current System after PARA
My current setup consists of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), Apple Notes, [Notion](https://notion.so), and [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/). Each app has their own limitation so I had to combine everything and integrate them together. 

I know some people put their todo list on their notes or maybe even Roam. I find that using a separate todo app is better so I use Things3 to keep track of my daily todo and also my goals either yearly or monthly.

I use Roam and Apple Notes to keep up with my thoughts and the things I am currently interested in. I think both of them is the best way for me to put all of my Resources.

I mainly use Notion to have all of my thoughts curated.

These are my thoughts and experiences from using the PARA Method. I am still doing experiments with the system and it will improve overtime. It is better to start than chasing perfection.

[Dan Shipper](https://twitter.com/danshipper) wrote a beautiful [article](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/if-your-system-was-a-house-would)  about it and here are some quotes from it.
> To be clear, you can build your hut using Notion, Roam, Evernote or a plaintext editor with grep. The tools themselves are not the problem. The problem is how we use them.
> We shouldnâ€™t feel like we have to make large, cumbersome, and expansive systems that try to accommodate every use case all at once.
> Instead, we should be making simple systems that we can live inside of. By living inside of them we can fix flaws as they come up, and get on with our day.
