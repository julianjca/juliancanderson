This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one too](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Work
I am currently working for [Jumpcut](https://jumpcut.com) as a Full Stack Engineer. I am grateful that I can work remotely especially in this kind of situation.

## Writing
I am creating my own [newsletter](https://juliancanderson.com/subscribe). I am trying to write regularly and currently sending email once a week.

I also write here in my own [blog](https://juliancanderson.com/blog). I am writing about self development and planning to do a book review too.

Currently relearning on how to do front end layouting. I found some interesting articles about it so I need to dig deeper into it.
