description: First time doing self quantifying project
---

This is my first quantifying project. The main reason to do this is to track my time and be more present. This project require dedication to build. It makes more more disciplined throughout the month.

I am currently using [airtable](https://airtable.com), [notion](https://notion.so), [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/id/watch/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Strava](https://strava.com), and [Last FM](https://last.fm) to track everything.

Hopefully I can improve the way I track and present every single month. I still have some ideas on what to track and haven't found a way to track it yet.
