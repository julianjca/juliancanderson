description: How to work remotely?
---

I am writing this in the middle of Corona Virus Pandemic. To be honest I am scared of it but being in a state of panic won't really help.

Many of us will work remotely soon and I have been working remotly for almost 6 months. I am not saying that I am a pro but I would love to give some tips on remote working.

## Make a schedule
It is easier to have a schedule when you work in an office. When you are working at home it will be harder since no one will know what you are doing every single day. Your family may interupt your work and it is the hardest thing to avoid. 

One thing that I have done for the past 6 months is have a schedule for the day. I usually set a fixed schedule for myself because I find it easier. Don't let your time slip away because you don't know what you should do at the given time.

## Exercise
Exercise is one of the most important thing even if you are not working remotely. Your energy won't be at the same level throughout the day. It is important to maintain your own energy level while working remotely. The reason is that it is easier to just take a nap or even sleep in the middle of your working time and you don't want that to happen.

## Eat healthy
Beside exercising the other thing that you can do to maintain your energy and fitness is by eating healthy meal. If you are working remotely then it is a really great chance to learn how to cook your own meal. Not only it is cheaper but it is also healthier than ordering food from food delivery services. One way to cook is just to do meal prep every Sunday. It will only take around 1 hour to do so. 

These are my favorite resources for meal prepping : [Meal prep playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfvuM_wAPe4a488LCFhLwIzNXforaiDDw), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/)

## Put your phone away
It is easier to access your smartphone when you work remotely. No one is going to judge you for being on your phone all day. Smartphone is distracting. You are committing to only take a look for 5 minutes and it turns out to be 30 minutes. I know that it is hard to control your smartphone usage, so one of the thing that we can do is to put it away, either in your drawer or in another room.

## Learn how to communicate
It is going to be hard not talking face to face with your teammates. You have to know how to communicate well and effectively. Make sure they know what you mean and if it is hard to be communicated via chat, call them. It is going to save you a lot of time.

## Take a Break
Don't forget to take a break if you are getting tired. Pushing your body beyond its limit won't do anything. You can try using [Pomodoro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNBmG24djoY) or you can choose how you are going to take your break.

These are the things I can think of for now. I might add more in the future and update this post.
I hope that this is helpful.

Take care, stay *inside*, and stay *healthy*!
