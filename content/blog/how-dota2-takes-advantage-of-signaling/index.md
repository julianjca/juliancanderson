description: How DOTA 2 Takes Advantage of Signaling
---

I have been into this game called DOTA2 since high school. My friends introduced me into the game and I was pretty bad at the game before because I never played this kind of game before. As I get better the game became more enjoyable for me. I have spent a lot of my time on the game, not just time but also money.

It is not a pay to win games. You don't get any buffs or advantages with the money that you spend. It might sounds silly but a lot of people do this with in game cosmetics. They want to have the latest and the best one out there. Some cosmetics are really cheap and some can cost [up to more than $1000](https://win.gg/news/4170/these-are-the-most-expensive-cosmetic-items-in-dota-2). I did not realize then that this is related to status signaling.

The company behind DOTA2 is Valve with [$10 billion valuation in 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/gabe-newell/#:~:text=Steam%20can%20support%20millions%20of,based%20analyst%20at%20Wedbush%20Securities.), who owns their own store called Steam.  Valve also owns some big titles such as Counter Strike Global Offensive, Half Life, and Team Fortress. 

In this blogpost we will take a deep dive into signaling in Video Games in the perspective of DOTA2.

## History of DOTA2
Defense of the Ancients(DOTA) began as a mod for Blizzard's Warcraft 3 in 2003. By the late 2000s, DOTA became one of the most popular mods worldwide, as well as a prominent esports game. Valve's interest in the Dota intellectual property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and executive Erik Johnson, became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel. Then the company was in talk with IceFrog and IceFrog announced his new position in October 2009 and Dota 2 was announced a year after that.

DOTA2 was planned to be a Social Network so in 2012 Gabe announced that it will be a free to play game. They were planning that [community contribution will be a cornerstone feature](https://web.archive.org/web/20120530235418/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dota-2010/1223419p1.html). And this decision paid out, by 2015, sales of Dota 2 virtual goods had earned Valve over $238 million in revenue, according to the digital game market research group SuperData. 

DOTA2 is really huge in Esports industry, in fact they have the [biggest price pool in Esports history](https://dotesports.com/general/news/biggest-prize-pools-esports-14605). Last year the prize pool was $34.3 million, this year has reached $37,834,903 and it's still increasing.

There are a lot of ways you can signal in DOTA2. Not just by buying in-game cosmetics, they also have a MMR (Match Making Rating), and Battle Pass Level. Let's dive to every single one of them:
