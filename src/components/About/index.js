              I am an <strong>Industrial Engineering Graduate</strong> that
              turned into a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. I rediscover my
              passion in tech in my last year of college and I went through a
              autodidact path when I first started. I mostly learned from
              articles and online courses. After a couple of months learning by
              myself I decided to enter a <strong>Coding Bootcamp</strong>{' '}
              called{' '}

              And after that the journey of becoming a Software Engineer was
              started. I learned a lot about Javascript inside the bootcamp.
              From <strong>Node JS, Vue, and React</strong>. I spent a lot of
              time exploring things that are outside of the Coding Bootcamp
              because I am passionate in what I do. I learned SCSS and also some
              CSS Animations.

              After I graduated I was hired to join a{' '}
              <strong>local tech startup</strong> in Indonesia. It was exciting
              because I can finally apply my knowledge in real world
              application. I have worked with both React and Vue professionally.
              I have also worked with Node JS and some of the backend stuffs.
