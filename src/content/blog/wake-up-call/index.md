It was 5 AM Monday morning. I woke up and I could not go back to sleep, then I reached my phone and checked Instagram out of boredom. The first thing on my feed was the news of Kobe Bryant. I am shocked and I thought it was just a joke or something. I scrolled more and I saw some stories. It did not feel real.

I grew up during Kobe's era in the NBA. I was not a huge NBA fan at that time. But I knew about Kobe because people talked about him a lot. I saw some videos of him and I loved it. I became his fans even if I did not buy any of his merch at that time. For me Kobe was the GOAT, more than MJ and more than LeBron.

His work ethic is what he was known for. He worked hard every single day. He said that he put all of his eggs on one basket, because he knew that it will work out in the end. There are a lot of great [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9GvDekiJ9c&t=1826s) out there with Kobe, but the one with [Valuetaiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9GvDekiJ9c&t=1826s) is one of the best. I think you will get so much value from it.

For me Kobe's death is a wake up call that I have always needed. 
His death made me rethink my life. 
I haven't done much. I haven't even impacted people around me.
I work hard, but I can work harder. 
There are still a lot of things that I want to achieve in my life. 

What are the things that you wish to achieve in life?
Have you worked towards it every single day?
Whatever you are doing right now, do it in the best way possible.
Life is short and tomorrow is not certain.
All we can do is focus on the present moment.

Another thing that I also realize because of his death is my relationship with people that I love.
I live away from my parents and I usually go back once a month to spend time with them. 
Right now I always try to call them at least once a day just to talk about anything and spend my time with them.

Have you spend your time with the people you love these days?
Don't take it for granted.
Be grateful that they are still there and let them know how much you love them.
